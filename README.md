Simple Menota XSD Schema Hosting

## About
With this repo, I'm aiming to provide simple hosting of a XSD schema for menota, until a better solution is found.

## License
I claim no authorship of any of the schemas in this repository.

The file `menotaP5.rng` was downloaded form the [Menota Website](http://www.menota.org/menotaP5.rng).  
All `.xsd` files were automatiacally genetated from the `.rng` using Oxygen XML editor.

The file `template.xml` is authored by Balduin Landolt, 02.04.2020 and licensed under the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).
